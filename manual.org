#+TITLE: User Maunal of Twidget

** Introduction
   *Twidget* means text widget. As we know, emacs has a widget library, but it's not easy to understand and use in my view. Twidget is much simplier and integrated with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Abstract-Display.html][ewoc]], thus makes it more powerful to implement complex interaction.

** Usage
*** Basic twidgets
    There are some basic text widgets (refered to as 'twidgets'):
    - twidget-text
    - twidget-choice
    - twidget-button

    Each type of twidget has some properties to determine the display and behavior of the widget. All the details will be introduced  one by one.
